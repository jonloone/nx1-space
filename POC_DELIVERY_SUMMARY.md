- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🔧 GraphXR Integration Steps

1. **Import Data**
   ```
   File > Import > JSON > Select graphxr_export.json
   ```

2. **Apply Geographic Layout**
   - Enable Map View
   - Set latitude/longitude properties
   - Nodes will auto-position on world map

3. **Configure Visual Encoding**
   - Size nodes by `investment_score`
   - Color by `investment_priority` (green=high, orange=medium, red=low)
   - Edge thickness by relationship strength

4. **Interactive Analysis**
   - Click stations to see full property panel
   - Filter by investment_priority = "high_priority"
   - Trace BRIDGES_WITH paths for network analysis

## 💡 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Singapore Bottleneck"
- Start: Singapore stations
- Reveal: Critical maritime corridor serving 9 regions
- Insight: $9.2M annual bridge value at risk

### Scenario 2: "Weather Resilience Gap"
- Filter: Stations affected by monsoon patterns
- Reveal: High-value Asian stations need redundancy
- Opportunity: Weather-hardened infrastructure investment

### Scenario 3: "Underserved Regions"
- Filter: Regions with connectivity_gap > 80
- Reveal: Multiple regions with only 1-2 serving stations
- Opportunity: Greenfield expansion potential

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Data**
   - Real-time satellite passes
   - Actual weather impact data
   - Commercial operator locations

2. **Advanced Analytics**
