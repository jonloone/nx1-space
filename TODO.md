# NexusOne Multi-Lens Intelligence Platform Tasks

## Current Sprint: Foundation Architecture ✅

### Phase 1: Foundation Architecture - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] Create FoundryWorkstation component as main container
- [x] Implement ViewManager for lens switching
- [x] Wrap existing Deck.gl in SpatialLens component (preserves all functionality)
- [x] Set up global state management with Zustand
- [x] Create Welcome/Entry screen with natural language query bar
- [x] Build floating lens selector navigation
- [x] Integrate into main app
- [x] Test implementation

### Phase 2: Template System - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Implement template infrastructure
- [ ] Create universal business view templates (Customer 360, BOM Analyzer, etc.)
- [ ] Build template loader and compatibility checker
- [ ] Add template-driven data mapping

### Phase 3: Lens Implementation - PENDING
- [ ] Create NetworkLens component with Sigma.js (placeholder ready)
- [ ] Create TemporalLens component with Visx (placeholder ready)
- [ ] Enhance HybridLens synchronized views (basic structure ready)
- [ ] Add real data connections to each lens

### Phase 4: AI Integration - PENDING
- [ ] Fix natural language query processing
- [ ] Create AI insights panel
- [ ] Build smart suggestion system
- [ ] Implement query-to-lens routing

### Phase 5: Save and Share - PENDING
- [ ] Build save/load functionality
- [ ] Create sharing mechanism
- [ ] Implement export options
- [ ] Add collaboration features

## Completed Components
- [x] FoundryWorkstation - Main container orchestrating all lenses
- [x] foundryStore - Zustand store with persistence for multi-lens state
- [x] WelcomeView - Entry point with query bar and quick start templates
- [x] LensSelector - Floating navigation for switching between lenses
- [x] SpatialLens - Wrapper preserving existing Deck.gl functionality
- [x] NetworkLens - Placeholder ready for Sigma.js integration
- [x] TemporalLens - Placeholder ready for Visx integration
- [x] HybridLens - Split-screen layout with multiple view options

## Architecture Decisions
- **State Management**: Zustand with persist middleware for browser storage
- **Component Loading**: Dynamic imports with lazy loading for performance
- **Layout System**: Flexible lens-based architecture with preserved existing code
- **UI Pattern**: Glass morphism with dark theme consistency
- **Navigation**: Floating lens selector with keyboard shortcuts (1-5)

## Next Steps
1. Install and integrate Sigma.js for network visualization
2. Install and integrate Visx for time-series charts
3. Connect real data to Network and Temporal lenses
4. Implement template system for business views
5. Fix CopilotKit integration for AI features

## Notes for Future Sessions
- NexusOne Foundry is live at http://137.220.61.218:3000
- All existing Deck.gl functionality preserved in SpatialLens
- Foundation architecture complete and ready for enhancement
- Focus next on real data integration for Network/Temporal lenses
