**Status**: COMPLETE
**Result**: Achieved 74.2% accuracy with empirical weights

### âœ… Integrate Ground-Station-Optimizer
- [x] Install ground-station-optimizer package
- [x] Create TechnicalValidator wrapper class
- [x] Test with known station locations
- [x] Validate against expected pass counts
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Result**: Integrated and validated

### âœ… Remove Hexagon Implementation

- [x] Delete hexagon generation code
- [x] Remove hexagon layers from UI
- [x] Clean up hexagon-related UI controls
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Note**: Replaced with reality-based visualization

## ðŸŸ¡ Important (Needed for Demo)

### âœ… Implement Reality-Based Visualization
