const prediction = await featureEngineering.predictSiteQuality(
  features,
  existingStations
);

console.log(`Site Score: ${prediction.site_quality_score}`);
console.log(`Confidence: [${prediction.confidence_interval[0]}, ${prediction.confidence_interval[1]}]`);
console.log(`Top Factors:`, prediction.contributing_factors.slice(0, 3));
