## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Service health and model status |
| POST | `/train` | Train Random Forest model |
| POST | `/predict` | Get prediction with SHAP explanations |
| GET | `/model/info` | Current model information |
| GET | `/model/feature-importance` | Feature importance rankings |
| DELETE | `/model` | Reset/clear current model |

## Usage Examples

### Start the Service
```bash
cd ml-backend
./start_service.sh
```

### Train a Model
```bash
./venv/bin/python train_ground_stations.py
```

### Make Predictions (TypeScript)
```typescript
import { mlClient } from '@/lib/services/ml-training-client'

const prediction = await mlClient.predictOpportunity(
  40.7128, -74.0060, // NYC coordinates
  { maritimeDensity: 75, gdpPerCapita: 65000 }
)

console.log(`Opportunity Score: ${prediction.score}`)
console.log(`Confidence: ${prediction.confidence * 100}%`)
```

## Model Performance

The service provides comprehensive metrics:
- **R² Score**: Model accuracy measurement
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV with confidence intervals  
- **Feature importance**: Ranked by Random Forest importance
- **SHAP values**: Individual prediction explanations
- **Confidence intervals**: Using ensemble variance
