# Ground Station Intelligence Platform - Project Roadmap

## Project Vision
Build a data-driven intelligence platform that identifies optimal locations for satellite ground stations based on real market opportunities, technical feasibility, and competitive landscape.

## Current Status: POC Development Phase
**Stage**: Fixing critical issues identified in audit before demo
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to demo-ready POC
**Focus**: Data science validity with lightweight implementation

## Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create a compelling POC that demonstrates $500M+ in quantified opportunities using real data and validated scoring models.

### Success Criteria
- [x] Scoring accuracy >70% when validated against 32 known stations
- [x] Real data from 5+ authoritative sources integrated
- [x] Confidence levels displayed on all recommendations
- [x] Smooth visualization of 1000+ scored locations
- [ ] Three compelling demo scenarios with clear ROI

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Status**: Complete
**Goal**: Fix critical statistical issues and remove arbitrary assumptions

Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Derived empirical weights from known station performance
- ✅ Integrated real orbital mechanics validation
- ✅ Removed hexagon-based visualization
- ✅ Implemented confidence scoring

### Phase 2: Reality-Based Visualization ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Status**: Complete
**Goal**: Replace abstract grids with operational reality

Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Implemented maritime density heatmaps
- ✅ Created satellite coverage footprints
- ✅ Built opportunity contour surfaces
- ✅ Added competition service areas

### Phase 3: Data Integration 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
**Status**: Partially Complete
**Goal**: Connect real data sources

Completed:
- ✅ Maritime data structure (EMODnet, AIS)
- ✅ Satellite TLE fetching (CelesTrak)
- ✅ Economic indicators (World Bank)
- ✅ Google Earth Engine authentication setup
- ✅ GEE REST API service implementation

In Progress:
- 🔄 Google Earth Engine production data integration
- ⏳ Real-time data pipeline
- ⏳ Caching layer optimization

### Phase 4: POC Demo Preparation
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Create compelling demonstration

Tasks:
- Build three scenario narratives
- Create presentation deck
- Prepare ROI calculations
- Test with stakeholders

## Key Deliverables

### Technical Deliverables
1. ✅ Scoring engine with empirical validation (74.2% accuracy achieved)
2. ✅ Web-based visualization platform (Reality-based layers implemented)
3. ✅ API for real-time opportunity scoring (REST endpoints active)
4. ✅ Validation report showing >70% accuracy (POC_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)

### Business Deliverables
1. 🔄 Opportunity heat map with $500M+ identified
2. ⏳ ROI analysis for top 10 locations
3. ⏳ Competitive gap analysis
4. ⏳ Investment prioritization matrix

## Risk Mitigation

### Addressed Risks
- ✅ Arbitrary scoring weights → Now empirically derived
- ✅ No validation → Using 32 known stations
- ✅ Abstract visualization → Moved to reality-based

### Remaining Risks
- ⚠️ Data freshness for maritime traffic
- ⚠️ Weather impact modeling simplified
- ⚠️ Competitive intelligence incomplete

## Next Milestones

1. **Week 1** ✅: Complete weight calibration and validation
2. **Week 2** ✅: Deploy reality-based visualization
3. **Week 3** 🔄: Run validation tests and prepare demo

## Definition of Done for POC

- [x] All scoring based on empirical data
- [x] Confidence levels visible throughout
- [ ] Three demo scenarios tell clear story
- [x] Validation shows >70% accuracy (74.2% achieved)
- [ ] Stakeholders approve for next phase
