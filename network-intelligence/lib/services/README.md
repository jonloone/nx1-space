## Usage Examples

### Basic Regional Analysis

```typescript
import { generateGroundStationOpportunities, h3GridService } from '@/lib/services/h3GridService';

// Analyze opportunities in specific regions
const analysis = generateGroundStationOpportunities({
  resolutions: [5, 6], // Regional and metro view
  focusRegions: [
    {
      name: 'Northeast US',
      bounds: { minLat: 35, maxLat: 45, minLon: -80, maxLon: -65 }
    }
  ],
  maxOpportunities: 50
});

console.log('Found', analysis.topOpportunities.length, 'opportunities');
console.log('Total investment potential:', analysis.summary.totalInvestmentPotential);
```

### Global High-Level Analysis

```typescript
// Global analysis for strategic planning
const globalAnalysis = generateGroundStationOpportunities({
  resolutions: [4], // Country-level view
  globalAnalysis: true,
  maxOpportunities: 100
});

// Filter for high-quality, low-risk opportunities
const premiumOpportunities = h3GridService.filterOpportunities(
  globalAnalysis.topOpportunities,
  {
    minScore: 80,
    maxRiskLevel: 'medium',
    minROI: 20,
    maxInvestment: 15000000 // $15M max
  }
);
```

### Custom Grid Generation

```typescript
// Generate custom opportunity grid
const customGrid = h3GridService.generateOpportunityGrid({
  resolutions: [6, 7], // Detailed analysis
  bounds: {
    minLat: 40,
    maxLat: 45,
    minLon: -75,
    maxLon: -70
  },
  minLandCoverage: 80,  // Minimum 80% land coverage
  maxHexagons: 200,
  includeCoastalOnly: true // Focus on coastal areas
});

// Get top opportunities from the grid
const topOpps = h3GridService.getTopOpportunities(customGrid, 25);
```

## Scoring Methodology

### Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is a weighted composite of individual factors:

- Market Score: 25% weight
- Competition Score: 20% weight  
- Weather Score: 15% weight
- Coverage Score: 15% weight
- Terrain Suitability: 15% weight
- Accessibility Score: 10% weight

### Market Score Factors

- Population density category (urban/suburban/rural/remote)
- Country market attractiveness based on economic factors
- Regional satellite demand patterns
- Infrastructure development level

### Competition Score Factors

- Distance to nearest competitor station
- Number of competitors within 5km, 25km, and 100km radii
- Competitor threat levels and market positions
- Market saturation indicators

### Weather Score Factors

- Latitude-based climate patterns
- Regional weather severity (storms, extreme temperatures)
- Rain fade and atmospheric interference potential
- Seasonal weather variations

### Coverage Score Factors

- GEO satellite visibility and elevation angles
- LEO constellation coverage advantages
- Orbital mechanics optimization

## Investment Modeling

### Investment Calculation

Base investment varies by hexagon resolution (facility size):
- Resolution 4 (large teleport): $15M base
- Resolution 5 (regional facility): $8M base
- Resolution 6 (metro facility): $6M base  
- Resolution 7 (detailed site): $5M base

Adjusted by:
- Terrain difficulty multiplier (1.0 - 1.6x)
- Accessibility multiplier (1.0 - 1.6x)
- Regulatory complexity factors

### Revenue Projection

Based on:
- Market opportunity score scaling
- Population density factors
- Regional demand patterns
- Competition impact on pricing

### ROI and Payback Analysis

- Simple ROI: Annual Revenue / Investment * 100

- Risk-adjusted returns based on geopolitical factors

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Categories

1. **Weather Risks**: Severe storms, extreme temperatures, seasonal disruptions
2. **Terrain Risks**: Construction challenges, geological instability
3. **Competition Risks**: Market saturation, pricing pressure
4. **Geopolitical Risks**: Regulatory restrictions, political instability
5. **Operational Risks**: Remote location challenges, maintenance access

### Risk Level Calculation

- Low (0-20 points): Stable, accessible locations with good weather
- Medium (21-40 points): Some challenges but manageable
- High (41-60 points): Significant challenges requiring mitigation
- Very High (60+ points): Extreme challenges, questionable viability

## Integration Points

### Land Detection Service
- Uses `lib/land-water-detection.ts` for land coverage analysis
- Filters out water-only hexagons
- Identifies coastal advantages

### Competitor Intelligence
- Integrates with `lib/data/competitorStations.ts`
- Calculates proximity to existing facilities
- Assesses competitive threat levels

### Business Intelligence
- Compatible with existing BI metrics in `lib/business-intelligence.ts`
- Provides investment and ROI calculations
- Supports expansion planning workflows

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Grid Sampling**: Uses efficient lat/lon stepping to avoid duplicate hexagons
2. **Land Filtering**: Early rejection of water-only areas
3. **Batch Processing**: Processes hexagons in resolution-based batches  
4. **Caching**: Land detection caching for repeated queries
5. **Bounded Analysis**: Focus on specific regions rather than global processing

### Scalability Limits

- Resolution 4: ~1000 hexagons for global analysis
- Resolution 7: Limited to regional areas (~200 km²)
- Memory usage scales with hexagon count
- Processing time: ~1-5 seconds for typical regional analysis

3. **Regional Optimization**: Local market factor customization
4. **Integration APIs**: Third-party data source integration

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Bounds**: Automatically corrected to valid lat/lon ranges
2. **No Land Coverage**: Returns empty results with explanation
3. **H3 Index Errors**: Validates H3 indices and handles malformed data
4. **Competition Data Missing**: Gracefully handles missing competitor information
