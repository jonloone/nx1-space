# MVP Implementation Status Report

## 🎯 Current State: TDD Tests Written, Ready for Implementation

### ✅ Completed
1. **TDD-Guard Framework**: Installed and configured
2. **Test Suite**: All critical tests written (6 test files, 50+ test cases)
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Jest configured with TypeScript support
4. **Test Data**: 32 known stations loaded in fixtures
5. **Test Runner**: `./run_tests.sh` created for progress tracking

### 🔄 Current Test Status

As expected in TDD, all tests are currently **FAILING** because the implementation hasn't been done yet. This is correct - we write tests first, then implement to make them pass.

```bash
❌ Weight Calibration - Waiting for implementation
❌ Confidence Scoring - Waiting for implementation  
❌ Hexagon Removal - Waiting for implementation
❌ Spatial Interpolation - Waiting for implementation
❌ Data Connections - Waiting for implementation
❌ 70% Accuracy Validation - Waiting for implementation
```

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap (Following Step-by-Step Guide)

### Step 1: Fix Scoring Weights ❌
**Files to Create:**
- `lib/scoring/empirical-weight-calibration.ts`
- `lib/scoring/weight-calibrator.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Load 32 known stations
// Run linear regression to find predictive weights
// Save weights to configuration
// Update scoring to use empirical weights
```

### Step 2: Add Confidence to Everything ❌
**Files to Create:**
- `lib/scoring/confidence-calculator.ts`
- `lib/scoring/market-scorer.ts` (update)
- `lib/scoring/technical-scorer.ts` (update)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate confidence based on data density
// Add confidence to all score outputs
// Range: 0-1 with uncertainty bands
```

### Step 3: Remove All Hexagon Code ⚠️
**Status:** Partially complete - h3-js still in package.json
**Actions Needed:**
- Remove h3-js from dependencies
- Delete hexagon layer components
- Clean up hexagon imports

### Step 4: Integrate Real Orbital Mechanics ❌
**Files to Create:**
- `lib/scoring/technical-validator.ts`
- Integration with ground-station-optimizer

### Step 5: Connect Real Data Sources ⚠️
**Status:** Google Earth Engine partially connected
**Working:**
- GEE authentication ✅
- Access token generation ✅

**Needs Implementation:**
- Actual satellite imagery retrieval
- Maritime AIS data connection
- Weather data integration

### Step 6-8: Reality-Based Visualization ❌
**Files to Create:**
- `components/map/layers/HeatmapLayer.tsx`
- `components/map/layers/ContourLayer.tsx`
- `lib/scoring/idw-spatial-interpolation.ts`

### Step 9-13: Demo Features ❌
- Maritime data visualization
- Station markers with scores
- Coverage footprints
- Competition layer
- Demo scenarios

### Step 14: Validate 70% Accuracy ❌
**Critical Requirement:**
- Must achieve >70% accuracy on 32 known stations
- Test: `tests/validation/test_known_stations_validation.test.ts`

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions

### For Implementation Team:

1. **Start with Step 1**: Create empirical weight calibration
   ```bash
   # Create the file
   touch lib/scoring/empirical-weight-calibration.ts
   
   # Implement to make this test pass
   npx jest tests/unit/test_weight_calibration.test.ts
   ```

2. **Then Step 2**: Add confidence scoring
   ```bash
   # Create confidence calculator
   touch lib/scoring/confidence-calculator.ts
   
   # Make this test pass
   npx jest tests/unit/test_confidence_scoring.test.ts
   ```

3. **Continue sequentially** through each step

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Run `./run_tests.sh` to see current progress:

```bash
./run_tests.sh

# Current output:
# ❌ All tests failing (expected - no implementation yet)
# 
# Goal output:
# ✅ All tests passing
# ✅ 70% accuracy achieved
# ✅ Demo ready
```

## 🎯 Definition of Done

The MVP is complete when:

- [ ] All 6 test suites pass
- [ ] 70% accuracy achieved on known stations
- [ ] No hexagons remain in codebase
- [ ] At least 2 real data sources connected
- [ ] Confidence shown on all predictions
- [ ] One complete demo scenario working
- [ ] Performance smooth with 1000+ points

## 💡 Implementation Tips

1. **Follow TDD Cycle:**
   - Red: Write/run test (fails)
   - Green: Implement minimal code to pass
   - Refactor: Clean up while keeping tests green

2. **Don't Skip Tests:**
   - Each test validates a critical requirement
   - Tests are the acceptance criteria

3. **Use Test Output as Guide:**
   - Test failures show exactly what's needed
   - Implement only what's required to pass

## 🔗 Quick Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx jest tests/unit/test_weight_calibration.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm run test:watch

# Check implementation progress
./run_tests.sh
```
