# deck.gl Implementation for Ground Station Intelligence

## Overview

Successfully migrated from Kepler.gl to deck.gl for the 3D ground station visualization. The new implementation provides:

- **3D columnar visualization** with investment scores as height
- **Color coding** based on investment recommendations (excellent/good/moderate/poor)
- **Interactive tooltips** with station details
- **Lightweight implementation** (~400KB vs Kepler.gl's ~2MB)
- **No Redux complexity** - simple vanilla JavaScript
- **MapLibre GL** integration (no Mapbox token required)

## Access Points

1. **Main deck.gl Visualization**: http://137.220.61.218:8090/
2. **Comparison Page**: http://137.220.61.218:8090/comparison.html
3. **Original Kepler.gl**: http://137.220.61.218:8090/kepler-simple-fix.html

## Features Implemented

### Visual Elements
- **3D Columns**: Height represents investment score (0-100)
- **Scatter Points**: Size represents antenna size
- **Text Labels**: Floating station names
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Green: Excellent investment opportunities
  - Yellow: Good investment opportunities
  - Orange: Moderate investment opportunities
  - Red: Poor investment opportunities

### Interactivity
- **Hover tooltips** showing:
  - Station name and operator
  - Country and region
  - Investment score and recommendation
  - Antenna size and frequency bands
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - Press 'R' to toggle auto-rotation
- **Navigation controls** for zoom, pitch, and bearing

### Data Integration
- Uses the same `kepler_ground_stations.json` data file
- All 50 commercial ground stations displayed
- Real investment scoring from the BI analysis

## Technical Stack

```javascript
// Core dependencies
- deck.gl v8.9.35 (3D visualization framework)
- MapLibre GL v3.6.2 (map rendering, Mapbox GL fork)
- CartoDB Dark Matter basemap (no API key required)

// Key layers used
- ColumnLayer (3D bars)
- ScatterplotLayer (sized points)
- TextLayer (labels)
- HeatmapLayer (optional density visualization)
```

## File Structure

```

├── deckgl-simple.html       # Main deck.gl visualization (deployed)
├── deckgl-index.html        # Full-featured version with controls
├── deckgl-app.js           # Application logic

```

## Advantages Over Kepler.gl

1. **Simpler Setup**
   - No Redux required
   - No complex state management
   - Direct layer control

2. **Better Performance**
   - Smaller bundle size
   - Faster load times
   - More efficient rendering

3. **Full Customization**
   - Complete control over UI
   - Custom interactions
   - Easy to extend

4. **Easier Integration**
   - Standard JavaScript
   - No framework lock-in
   - Simple to embed

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Visualizations
```javascript
// Arc connections between stations
new deck.ArcLayer({
    id: 'connections',
    data: stationPairs,
    getSourcePosition: d => d.source,
    getTargetPosition: d => d.target
})

// Coverage heatmap
new deck.HeatmapLayer({
    id: 'coverage',
    data: groundStations,
    getPosition: d => [d.longitude, d.latitude],
    getWeight: d => d.overall_investment_score
})

// Hexagon aggregation
new deck.HexagonLayer({
    id: 'hex-density',
    data: groundStations,
    extruded: true,
    radius: 200000,
    elevationScale: 4000
})
```

### Interactive Features
- Filter by investment score
- Filter by operator
- Show/hide layers
- Export view as image
- Time-based animations

## Deployment

The deck.gl visualization is deployed via Docker/nginx at:
- http://137.220.61.218:8090/

To update:
```bash
# Edit the HTML/JS files
vim deckgl-simple.html

# Copy to container
docker cp deckgl-simple.html kepler-demo:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Visualization updates immediately (no build required)
```

## Conclusion

The migration to deck.gl provides a cleaner, more performant solution while maintaining all the visual features needed for the ground station investment intelligence POC. The 3D visualization effectively communicates investment opportunities through intuitive visual encoding (height, color, size).
