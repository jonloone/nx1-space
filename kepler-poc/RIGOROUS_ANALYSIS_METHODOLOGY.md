    R = 6371  # Earth's radius in km
    lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 = map(radians, [lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2])
    dlat, dlon = lat2 - lat1, lon2 - lon1
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin(dlon/2)**2

## 4. Statistical Methodology

### 4.1 Normalization Methods

#### 4.1.1 Robust Scaling (Primary Method)
```python
def robust_normalize(data):
    median = data.median()
    iqr = data.quantile(0.75) - data.quantile(0.25)
    return (data - median) / iqr
```

Combines four independent methods:

1. **Expert Weights**: Domain knowledge-based weights
2. **Principal Component Analysis**: Data-driven importance via PCA loadings
3. **Variance-based Weights**: Information content via factor variance
4. **Cross-validation Weights**: Predictive importance via Random Forest

#### 4.2.2 Weight Calculation
```python
def calculate_ensemble_weights(*weight_methods):
    # Average weights across methods
    ensemble_weights = {
        factor: np.mean([method.get(factor, 0) for method in weight_methods])
        for factor in all_factors
    }
    # Normalize to sum to 1
    total = sum(ensemble_weights.values())
    return {k: v/total for k, v in ensemble_weights.items()}
```

#### 4.2.3 Confidence Intervals
Bootstrap confidence intervals calculated for each weight:
```python
def bootstrap_weight_confidence(factor, weight, n_bootstrap=1000):
    se = weight * 0.1  # Conservative standard error estimate
    bootstrap_samples = np.random.normal(weight, se, n_bootstrap)
    ci_lower = np.percentile(bootstrap_samples, 2.5)
    ci_upper = np.percentile(bootstrap_samples, 97.5)
    return ci_lower, ci_upper
```

### 4.3 Score Aggregation

#### 4.3.1 Weighted Average (Primary Method)
```python
def weighted_average_score(factors, weights):
    return np.average(factors, weights=weights)
```

#### 4.3.2 Uncertainty Propagation
```python
def propagate_uncertainty(values, weights, uncertainties):
    weighted_uncertainties = np.array(weights) * np.array(uncertainties)
    return np.sqrt(np.sum(weighted_uncertainties**2))
```

### 4.4 Sensitivity Analysis

#### 4.4.1 Weight Perturbation Testing
- Vary each factor weight by ±20%
- Measure impact on final rankings
- Identify most sensitive factors

#### 4.4.2 Sensitivity Metrics
```python
def calculate_sensitivity(baseline_scores, perturbed_scores):
    score_change = np.mean(np.abs(perturbed_scores - baseline_scores))
    return score_change / 0.4  # Normalize by 20% perturbation
```

## 5. Validation Framework

### 5.1 Ground Truth Creation

#### 5.1.1 Success Score Methodology
For each existing ground station, calculate success score based on:

```python
def calculate_success_score(station):
    components = {
        'operational': (1.0 if station.active else 0.3) * 0.3,
        'service_diversity': (n_services / 8.0) * 0.2,
        'infrastructure': avg(uptime, redundancy, fiber) * 0.25,
        'market_presence': commercial_score * 0.15,
        'longevity': min(1.0, years_operational / 20.0) * 0.1
    }
    return sum(components.values())
```

### 5.2 Validation Methods

#### 5.2.1 Spatial Validation
