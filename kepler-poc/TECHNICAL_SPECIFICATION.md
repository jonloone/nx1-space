## 1. Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Core Scoring Algorithm

The overall investment score is computed as:

```
S_overall = Σ(i=1 to 5) w_i × S_i × C_i × T_i × L_i
```

Where:
- `S_i` = Category score (i ∈ {Market, Infrastructure, Technical, Competition, Regulatory})
- `w_i` = Category weight (Σw_i = 1)
- `C_i` = Context adjustment factor
- `T_i` = Temporal adjustment factor
- `L_i` = Local influence factor

### 1.2 Category Score Calculation

Each category score is calculated as:

```
S_i = Σ(j=1 to n_i) w_ij × T_ij(f_ij × q_ij)
```

Where:
- `f_ij` = Raw factor value j in category i
- `q_ij` = Data quality score for factor j
- `w_ij` = Factor weight within category i
- `T_ij` = Non-linear transformation function

### 1.3 Non-Linear Transformations

#### Exponential Demand Transformation
For demand-driven factors (population, GDP, traffic):

```python
def exponential_demand(x, steepness=2.0, threshold=0.5):
    normalized_x = clip(x, 0, 1)
    if normalized_x < threshold:
        return (normalized_x / threshold) ** (1/steepness)
    else:
        return 1 - ((1 - normalized_x) / (1 - threshold)) ** steepness
```

#### Logarithmic Infrastructure Transformation
For infrastructure factors with diminishing returns:

```python
def logarithmic_infrastructure(x, base=10.0):
    normalized_x = clip(x, 1e-6, 1)
    return log(1 + normalized_x * (base - 1)) / log(base)
```

#### Sigmoid Risk Transformation
For risk factors requiring penalty functions:

```python
def sigmoid_risk(x, midpoint=0.5, steepness=10.0):
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (x - midpoint)))
```

#### Step Penalty Function
For factors with hard constraints:

```python
def step_penalty(x, thresholds):
    for threshold, penalty in thresholds:
        if x > threshold:
            return penalty
    return 1.0
```

#### Gaussian Optimal Range
For factors with optimal operating ranges:

```python
def gaussian_optimal(x, optimal=0.5, sigma=0.2):
    return exp(-0.5 * ((x - optimal) / sigma) ** 2)
```

### 1.4 Local Context Analysis

Local influence is calculated using:

```
L_i = 1 + α × cluster_strength - β × competition_pressure
```

Where:
- `cluster_strength` = Network effects from nearby economic activity
- `competition_pressure` = Competitive pressure from existing stations
- `α, β` = Tunable parameters (default: α=0.05, β=0.1)

Spatial influence uses Haversine distance weighting:

```python
def haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    R = 6371  # Earth's radius in km
    dlat = radians(lat2 - lat1)
    dlon = radians(lon2 - lon1)
    a = sin(dlat/2)**2 + cos(radians(lat1)) * cos(radians(lat2)) * sin(dlon/2)**2
    return 2 * R * arcsin(sqrt(a))
```

### 1.5 Temporal Adjustments

Seasonal adjustment:
```
T_seasonal = f_base × seasonal_multiplier[quarter]
```

Growth trend adjustment:
```
T_growth = f_base × (1 + growth_rate) ** years_ahead
```

Market maturity factor (S-curve):
```
T_maturity = 1 / (1 + exp(-k × (market_age - midpoint)))
```

    # Multi-objective score with entropy regularization
    objective = 0.4 * mse + 0.3 * mae - 0.3 * r2
